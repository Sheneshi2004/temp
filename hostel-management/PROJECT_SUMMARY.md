## 🎯 HOW TO VERIFY EVERYTHING WORKS

### Step 1: Start Application
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd D:\Hostel_Management\hostel-management\hostel-management

# Run
mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

### Step 2: Check Console Output
Look for:
```
🌱 Seeding default data...
✅ Seeding complete.
Started HostelManagementApplication in X.XXX seconds
```

### Step 3: Test in Browser
1. Open: http://localhost:8080
2. Login as admin (admin/admin123)
3. You should see the dashboard with stats
4. Click through each menu item
5. Try adding a room
6. Try adding a resident
7. Try creating a payment

### Step 4: Test API Directly
```bash
# Get all rooms
curl http://localhost:8080/api/rooms

# Get room stats
curl http://localhost:8080/api/rooms/stats

# Get all residents
curl http://localhost:8080/api/residents
```

## 📞 SUPPORT

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: Port 8080 in use**
```properties
# Change in application.properties
server.port=8081
```
Update API_BASE in dashboard.js to match.

**Issue: Can't connect to database**
- Check MySQL is running
- Verify credentials in application.properties
- Ensure database exists

**Issue: Build fails**
- Check Java version: `java -version` (must be 21)
- Clean build: `mvnw.cmd clean install`

**Issue: API calls fail in browser**
- Check backend is running
- Open browser console (F12)
- Check for CORS errors
